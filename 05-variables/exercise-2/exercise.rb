# We have added a new task to disable SNMP port in the playbook. 
# However the port is hardcoded in the playbook.
# Update the inventory file to add a new variable "snmp_port" and assign the value used here. 
# Then update the playbook to use value from the variable.
# Remember to use quotes around the variable name.
